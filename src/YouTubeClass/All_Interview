*   Calculating Time Complexity
        Now lets tap onto the next big topic related to Time complexity, which
        is How to Calculate Time Complexity. It becomes very confusing some times,
        but we will try to explain it in the simplest way.


* JVM:
    - is java virtual machine the jvm actually runs java byte code
    .class files
    - write once and run everywhere -> bytecode

* JRE:
    - is java runtime environment is what you need to run a java program
    and contains a jvm among other things.

* JDK:
    - is java developer kit -- the jdk is what you need to compile
    java source code. java to .class file
    - to program in java you will need jdk you can install JDK from
    oracle website.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between Path and classPath?
    - Path:
         is used to define where the executables are .exe files
         java.exe, javac.exe etc
    - Class path:
         is used to specify location of Java.class files

    - java source code -> compile (javac) -> bytecode .class extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* versions of java you worked with?
* what is the difference between Java 7 and 8?
    - Version           Release         end public dates
    - Java SE 7         2011
    - Java SE 8         2014            january 2019, december 2020
    - Java SE 9         2017            March 2018
    - Java SE 10        2018            September 2018

      JAVA 7              vs            JAVA 8 }
    - String in                        - Lambda Expression
    Switch statement                   - pipelines and Streams
    - Multiple Exeception              - date and time API
    Handling                           - Java 8 interface changes
                                        Static Method, Default
                                        Method
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is garbage collector and how many types?

    - Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap
    memory identifying which objects are in use and which are not
    and deleting unused objects
    - An in use object or a referenced object means that some
    part of your program still maintains a pointer to that
    object

    * Garbage Collectors
        - serial : works with a single thread works for single
                    threaded apps
        - parallel: uses multiple threads for managing heap space
        - CSM: (current mark sweep) uses multiple GC threads
        - G1: is designed for application running on multiprocessor
        machines with large memory space. breaks heap into smaller regions

    * how to call Garbage Collector?
        - System.gc();
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Explain Public Static void main (String args[])
    - public:
            public is an access modifies which is used to specify who
            can access this method. Public means that this method will be
            accessible by any Class.
    - static:
            It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class bases i.e
            it can be accessed without creating the instance of a class
    - void:
            it is the return type of the method void defines the method which
            will not return any value
    - main:
            it is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a
            starting point for an application with a particular signature only.
            it is the method where the main executions occurs
    - String args:
            it is the parameter passed to the main method
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* can one class call another class main method?
    - yes a main method can be called in another class main method
    - code will compile without main method but will not run
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what are the primitives and wrapper classes?
    - every primitive data type has a class dedicated to it
    - these are known as wrapper classes because they wrap the primitive data type
    into an object of that class.
    - we can convert from one type to another using casting

    * PRIMITIVE         * WRAPPER CLASS         * CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENT
    boolean             Boolean                  boolean or String
    byte                Byte                     byte or String
    char                Character                char
    int                 Integer                  int or String
    float               Float                    float double or String
    double              Double                   double or String
    long                Long                     long or String
    short               Short                    short or String
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* implicit casting vs explicit casting?
    - Implicit Casting:
        int i = 100;
        double d = i;

    - Explicit Casting:
        int n = 12;
        byte b = (byte)n;

    - Auto - Boxing
        Integer num = n;

    - Un - Boxing
        int j = num;

DONT WORK:
            Integer i = new Integer(100);
            double d = i ; // will not work

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between Instance Variable and static Variable?
    - Static Variables:
                    belongs to the class itself not to objects
                    of the class, different objecst can not have different
                    values for a static variable. only one copy of static variable
                    for everyone. Every object instance of a class has its own copy
                    of each instance variable declared in the class

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is constructor in java
* what is the difference between constructor and method?
    - A constructor in java is a block of code similar to a method thats called
    when an instance of an object is created. Difference between constructor and
    method:
        - A constructor doesnt have a return type
        - the name of the constructor must be the same as the name of the class
        - unlike methods constructors are not considered members of a class
        - a constructor is called automatically when a new instance of object
        is created
        - the purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object of a class
        while the purpose of a method is to perform a task by executing java code
        - default constructor is added if programmer did not add a constructor.

                                Types of Java Constructor
                                        |
                                        |
                    ------------------------------------------
                    |                                         |
            default constructor                       parameterized constructor

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Can a super() and this() keywords be in same constructor?
    - public computer(){
        this();
        super();
        //code
    }
    - NO they both need to be in first line within constructor.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Super. VS Super()
    - super.
            is used to access parent/super class members vars, methods
    - super()
            is used to call super class constructor

* this. VS this()
    - this.
            this object by using this. we can access instance variables and
            method. to differentiate between instance and argument variable
    - this()
            call a constructor from another constructor in same class

    Example:
        public class computer{
            private String brand;

            public computer(){
                this("apple");
            }
            public computer (String brand){
                this.brand = brand;
            }
        }
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is the difference between access modifiers in java?
    Modifier       Class    Package     Subclass    World
    - public         Y          Y           Y          Y
    - protected      Y          Y           Y          N
    - no modifier    Y          Y           N          N
    - private        Y          N           N          N

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is static keyword in java?
    - Static keyword means that the variable or method belongs to class
      and shared between all instances.
    - we can call static members by using class name or object
    - static methods can not call/refer Non Static members
    - Static can be: variables, method, block, inner class

    public class Computer{
        private String brand;
        public Computer(){
             this("Apple");
             }
        public Computer(String brand) {
            this.brand = brand; }
            public static class Memory{
                private int ramsize;
            }
        }
        Memory c = new Computer().new Memory();
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Static block and instance initializer block?
    - the static initializer block will be called on loading of the class and code
      will run only once in the begining
    - instance initializer block execute every time you create an object
      for a class. before any constructor.

    Example:
        public class programer{
            System.out.println("constructor")
        }
        static{
            System.out.println("static")
        }
        {
             System.out.println("instance ")
        }

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* pass by value or pass by reference?
    - Java is a “pass-by-value” language. This means that a copy of
    the variable is made and the method receives that copy. Assignments
    made in the method do not affect the caller.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* final vs finally vs finalize()
    - Final:
            - final is a keyword
            - final is used to apply restriction on class method and variable
            - if a class is marked as final then this class can not be inherited
              by any other class
    - finally:
            - finally is a block
            - finally is a block which is used for exception handling along with
              try and catch blocks
    - Finalize:
            - finalize() method is protected method of java.lang.object class
              it is inherited to every class you create in java
            - finalize() methos id used to perform some clean up operations
              on a object before it is removed from memory

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* where did you use static in your framework?
    - I normally write utility classes for better reusability and make
      all methods in my utilities as static methods so that i can easily
      call them by class name.
    - dataseUtil class has static methods to connect and run queries and
      get data
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between equals method and "==" operator in java?
    - "==":
            reference and address comparison
            == in case of primitives it is checking the value. as primitives are
            single value without any behavior.
    - equals()
            content comparison

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is String pool?
    - String Pool in javais a pool of Strings stored inJava Heap Memory. Used to
      save space in memory.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* how to reverse String in java?
    1:
        String string="whatever";
        String reverse = newStringBuilder(string).reverse().toString();
        System.out.println(reverse);
    2:
        String result="";
        for(int i = string.length()-1; i>=0; i--){
            result = result+ string.charAt(i);
        }
        System.out.println(result);

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* how to reverse a sentence word by word?
    StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    String [] words = string.split(" ");
    for(int j = words.length-1; j>=0; j--){
        stringBuilder.append(words[j].append("");
    }
    System.out.println("reverse Words "+ stringBuilder.toString().trim());

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer?
                STRING          STRINGBUFFER             STRINGBUILDER
Storage         constant        HEAP                    Heap
Area            String pool

Modifiable      no(inmutable)   YES(mutable)            YES(mutable)

Thread Safe     YES             YES                     NO

Performance     FAST            VERY SLOW               FAST

Inmutable means values can not be changed once its created:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is Tread-safe or Synchronized?
    - what is tread: A sequential or single threaded program has single flow
    - synchronized: Means that two threads can not execute the method
      or access the variables at the same time and the JVM takes care of
      enforcing that. it is used to achieve thread-safety
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* how to check if String is palindrome?
    - civic = civic <- is a palindrome
    - public static boolean isPalindrome(String str){
        if(str==null)
        return false;
        StringBuilder strBuilder = new StringBuilder(str);
        strBuilder.reverse();
        return strBuilder.toString().equals(str);
    }
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?
    - Ensures that a class has only one instance and provide a global point
    of access to it
    public class SingletonExample{
    // static member holds only one instance of the singleton class
      private static singletonExample singletonInstance;

    // singleton prevents any other class from instantiating
      private SingletonExample(){
      }
    }

Example:

    - Singleton Example in Java

      public class dbaseConnector{
          private static final dbaseConnector instance = new DbaseConnect();

          private dbaseConnector(){
              //construction code ....
          }
          public static DbaseConnector getInstance(){
              return(instance);
          }
      }

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is armstron ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* how to prevent Instantiation of a class?
    - private constructor
    - abstract class
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what are OOP concepts in Java?
    - encapsulation
    - inheritance
    - abstraction
    - polymorphism

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is encapsulation and how did you use it?
    - data: hiding by making variables private and providing public
      getter and setter methods.
    - in my project i created multiple POJO/BEAN classes in order to manage
      test data and actual data.

    EX: I take JSON from API response and convert to object of my POJO
      class all variables are private with getters and setter.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is JSON
    - Java Script Object Notation.
    - Json is format of Rest there are 3 formats which are JSON, XML, TEXT

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is inheritance and benefits of it?
    - inheritance is a process when a sub class inherits members from super class.
      All public and protected and sometimes default members are inherited to
      sub class.
    - we will achieve code re-usability and code organization with it. also
    very useful for polymorphic programing.
    - test base is super class and other test classes are sub classes.

    EX: we had a page object for one page and as another page contained same
    elements i used inheritance in order to reuse the elements defined in super page
    object class in selenium webdriver.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is abstraction in java and purpose?
    - in General using abstraction in programing we can create a base/blueprint
    for our code and let sub classes implement as needed according to requirements

    hiding the implementation and showing only behavior

    2 ways to achieve abstraction in JAVA:
    1) Abstract Classes
    2) interfaces
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between Abstract class and interface?
    - difference between abstract class and interface in java
    - types of methods: interface can have only abstract methods. abstract
    class can have abstract and non abstract methods. from java 8 it can have default
    and static methods also.
    - final variables: variables declared in ajva interface are by default final.
    an abstract class may contain non final variables
    - a class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can exted only single
    abstract class. java does not support multiple inheritance
    - methods
            - in interface: abstract static defaults,
            - in abstract class: abstract non-abstract static
    - abstract class can have a constructor
      interface can not have a constructor
    - interface can implement other interfaces(multiple)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* why java does not support multiple inheritance?
    - two classes may define different ways of doing the same thing and the subclass
    cant choose which one to pick
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Difference between overloading and overriding?
    1: overlaoding = same method name but different parameters
       overriding = same method name and same paramethers

    2: overloading = return type can be different
       overriding = same type or sub type

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Can you override a static method?
    - No static methods can not be overriden, they can only be
      hidden.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is static binding vs dynamic/runtime binding?
    - Static binding is overloading and
    - dynamic binding is method overriding.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is polymorphism ? where did we use it on framework?
    - Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
      The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent
      class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

        - DYNAMIC POLYMORHISM - OVERRIDING
        - STATIC POLYMORHISM - OVERLOADING
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Data Structures and Why we need it
    - Data structures are way of organizing data for efficient
      manipulation: Insertion , searching, reading , deletion of
      data.

    - I always use java data structures for reading data and storing
      data from our application , database, or API.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* How do you create an Array or dynamic array?
    - int [] nums = new int [7];
      nums [0] = 100;
      nums [1] = 100;
      nums [2] = 100;
      nums [3] = 100;
      nums [4] = 100;
      nums [6] = 100;

    - Java does not support dynamic Arrays
      You have to use ArrayList for dynamism.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* How to read unique values from Array?
    - int [] nums = new int [7];
    nums [0] = 44;
    nums [1] = 32;
    nums [2] = 100;
    nums [3] = 100;
    nums [4] = 7;
    nums [5] = 7;

    public static void main (String[] args){
// 1st way
        int [] nums = new int [6];
        nums [0] = 44;
        nums [1] = 32;
        nums [2] = 100;
        nums [3] = 100;
        nums [4] = 7;
        nums [5] = 7;

        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            set.add(nums[i]);
        }
        System.out.println(set);
// 2nd way
        String uniqNums="";
        for (int n:nums) {
            if (!uniqNums.contains(String.valueOf(n)))
                uniqNums = uniqNums+n+" ";
        }
        System.out.println(uniqNums);
    }
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* How to print unique values from String?
    -
     public static void main (String[] args){

        String str = "aaabbcccdddeereeegggg";
        // 1st print only unique values from string
        Set<Character> setC = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            setC.add(str.charAt(i));
        }
        System.out.println(setC);
        // 2nd print only unique values from string
        String unique ="";
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            if(!unique.contains(str.charAt(i)+"")) {
                unique += str.charAt(i);
            } }
        System.out.println(unique);
    }
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between array and arraylist?
    - Array is fixed size ArrayList is dynamic
    - Array can store primitive type ArrayList only wrapper types and Objects
    - Array can be multi-dimensional ArrayList is not
    - Array is faster and ArrayList is slower
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is Iterator and difference between for each loop?
    - Iterator works with arrayList and not array. It will help us
      Iterate through the elements.
    - Difference is with iterator you can make changes(remove item)
      to the list while iterating.
      within for each loop we can not make changes to our list

// for each loop:

      int arr[] = {23,54,6,56,76,878,9};
           for(int n : arr) {
                System.out.println(n);
}
           System.out.println("================");

           List<Integer> · = new ArrayList<>();
           list.add(23);
           list.add(2323);
           list.add(2312);
           list.add(2343);
           list.add(2553);

// Iterator loop:

           Iterator<Integer> it = list.iterator();
           while(it.hasNext()) {
                Integer n = it.next();
                System.out.println(n);
                it.remove();
           }
           System.out.println(list);
           System.out.println("================");
           for(Integer n : list) {
                System.out.println(n);
                //list.remove(n);
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* How to join 2 arrays into single array?
    - I am sure there are different ways to solve this solution I
      am coming up at at this point is:

    1. I would create a thrid a array with the size of
    2. other other arrays and assign each value from Both arrays
       into a 3rd array using a loop.
    3. I can create an array list and loop through each Item in
       2 arrays and add them to arraylist,
       Then I can convert Arraylist into array if needed.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
* List vs Set vs Map interfaces
    - LIST: - can store duplicate values,
            - maintains /keeps the insertion order
            - list allows any number of null values
            - Comes from collection interface
            - from list we can read a certain value by index
    - SET : - can only store unique values.
            - set does not maintain order
            - set allows only 1 null
            - Comes from collection interface
            - set doesnt allow that

    - MAP : is a key+value format and keys are always unique
            - map read value by passing key
            - map can have single null key but multiple null values
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is hashcode and equals method used for?
    - I created multiple POJO(Plain old Java object) classes
      to store data that came from different sources.
      Like Database, API JSon format, Excel, CSV file, Webtable.

    - And whenever I needed unique set of pojos, I had to override
      hashCode and equals methods, that by storing into HASHSET ,
      I was sure that only unique objects are being stored.

    - Any challenges you had and how did you solve them?
      When did you have to override hashCode and equals methods?
      In my project, I had to validate data from web-tables, database, JSON ,
      Excels etc. As they all come in different formats, It was challenging
      to work with them and assert that they are correct and exptected.
      So What I did was I created multiple POJOs to match my app data.
      And sometimes, I need unique POJO objects, I override hashCode and equals methods.

    - How did you use data structures in automation?
      In my project, I had to validate data from web-tables, database, JSON ,
      Excels etc. As they all come in different formats, It was challenging to
      work with them and assert that they are correct and exptected.
      So I stored all data from different sources into Java Data structures.
      like Lists, Maps etc. and compared/asserted to expected.

    = Example:
        Employee emp1 = new Employee(100);
        Employee emp2 = new Employee(100);
        Employee emp3 = new Employee(110);
        System.out.println(emp1.equals(emp2));

        Integer i1 = new Integer(100); Integer i2 = new Integer(100);
        System.out.println(i1.hashCode());
        System.out.println(i2.hashCode());
        Set<Employee> set = new HashSet<>(); set.add(emp1);
        set.add(emp2);
        set.add(emp3);
        System.out.println(set.size());

        class Employee {
        private int id;
        public Employee(int id) { this.id=id;
        }
        public int getId() {
        return id;
        public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
        } }
        @Override
        public int hashCode() { return id;
        }
        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return this.id == ((Employee)other).id;
        }
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* How do you sort an object that you created?
    - I implement Comparable interface and override compareTo method.
    Then whenever I store my objects into a List then use Collections.Sort
    it will be able to sort. Also I can store my objects into a TreeSet or TreeMap.

    public static void main (String[] args){

        Employee emp1 = new Employee(500);
        Employee emp2 = new Employee(100);
        Employee emp3 = new Employee(110);
        List list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(emp1);
        list.add(emp2);
        list.add(emp3);
        Collections.sort(list);
        for (Object object : list) {
            System.out.println(object);
        }
    }

}
class Employee implements Comparable<Employee>{
    private int id;
    public Employee(int id) {
        this.id=id;
    }
    public int getId() {
        return id; }
    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return id;
    }
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return this.id == ((Employee)other).id;
    }
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Employee emp) {
        if(this.id > emp.id) {
            return 1;
        }else if(this.id < emp.id) {
            return -1;
        }
        return 0; }
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return id+"";
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* ArrayList vs LinkedList
    - Arraylist is ordered collection like array.
    - linkedList consists of nodes:
        1: Singly Linked Linked List
        value + pointer to next node
        2: doublyLinked LinkedList:
        Value + pointer to previous node and pointer to next node

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* ArrayList vs Vector?
    - They both implement List Interface and maintains insertion order
    - ArrayList
        - is not synchronized
        - its fast because its not synchronized
    - Vector
        - is synchronized
        - slow because its synchronized
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* HashSet vs HashMap
    - HashSet stores unique elements
    - HashSet implements Set
    - HashSet stores Single Objects

    - HashMap stores unique keys, and duplicated values

    - HashMap implements Map
    - HashMap stores Key, Value paired objects
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Hashtable vs HashMap
    - Both key + value
    - both implement MAP
    - HashMap: Not Synchronized, only 1 null key and multiple null values
    - Hashtable: its synchronized, no null keys or values
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Stack vs Queve
    - queve: first in first out
    - Stack: last in first out
--------------------------------------------------------------
* treeset vs TreeMap
    - TreeSet: Can contain only unique values
    - is sorted in ascending order
    - TreeMap: can contain only unique keys.
    - keys are sorted in ascending order
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Exception handling in java?
    - Depending on situation, we can use try catch finally blocks.

        TRY : Code that might throw some exception

        CATCH: We define exception type to be caught
        And what to do if exception happens in TRY block code

        FINALLY: Code that always runs , regardless if there is Exception or no.

        FINALLY block: WILL NOT RUN if JVM crashes, or System.exit(0) Is present
        in try or catch blocks. Clean up code, to close some connections, close
        open files etc

        example:
        public static void testCatch() {
            try {
               int i = 4/0;
            }catch(Exception e) {
               return;
            }finally {
               System.out.println(“FINALLY!”);//will run
            }
  }
--------------------------------------------------------------
* What is the parent of all exceptions?
    - Throwable class is parent

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What types of Exeception do you know?

    - CHECKED -> You handle or declare, otherwise will Not compile.
    - UNCHECKED -> Subclasses of RUNTIMEEXCEPTION. And optional to handle or no.
--------------------------------------------------------------
* what is throw vs throws
    -THROW VS THROWS:
      THROW : -> CREATES AN EXCEPTION OBJECT
      throw new RuntimeException();
      THROWS -> goes to method signature, And declares that a method
      might throw And exception
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Types of exceptions you faced in your project
    -
    JAVA : NULLPOINTER EXCEPTION, ILLEGALARGUMENT, CLASSNOTFOUND,
    FILENOTFOUND, CLASSCAST, ARITHMETIC, INDEXOUTOFBOUNDS,.. SQLEXCEPTION, IOEXCEPTION

    SELENIUM: NOSUCHELEMENT, STALEELEMENT, NOTCLICKABLE, NOTVISIBLE,
    TIMEOUTEXEPTION, WEBDRIVER, ILLEGALSTATE EXP, NO SUCHWINDOW, ALERTNOTFOUND...

    CUCUMBER: PENDINGEXCEPTION, DUPLICATE METHOD IMPLEMENTATION EXP,

==== SELENIUM REVIEW ====

SELENIUM GRID:
       node

    YOU HAVE YOUR CODE --> REMOTE DRIVER -> SELENIUM HUB  ->  node

                                                              node
    EXAMPLE: WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver( , )


* SauceLabs
    - they provide testing in cloud

* Selenium Grid
    - Gives you avility to run your automated tests in different browsers
    and versions and operating systems.
    - open source tool that is part of Selenium Suite

* what is test automation and what are the benefits?
	- no human interaction
	- fast
	- reliable
	- scalable
	- data driven testing

* what can be automated?
	- Something stable
	- Smoke / sanity test
    - functional test
    - Test data creating
    - API
    - Database

* what Test case should be automated?
    - must be stable test case
    - should be repetitive, can be used more than once
    - should not need any human interaction
    - should have a value, High ROI

* What are the common test automation tools?
    - Watir, selenium, UFT

* What is SELENIUM?
    - selenium is a tool that automates browser, it is used
    for testing

* Advantages of selenium?
    - Open source
    - interact with web application
    - supports multiple browsers, operating systems
    - supports different languages
    - reusability
    - community

* Disadvantage of Selenium?
    - it only supports web applications
    - no official support / no help desk
    - can not work with graphics, capchas, bar codes, shapes
    - no built in reporting tool
    - hard to master requires develoepr level knowledge
    - hard to write good locators
    - hard to synchronize

* what we dont do in selenium?
    - performance, load, stress testing, manual, ad hoc testing
    usability pure database testing (if we only test the db it self)
    , unit tests.. we dont do it. look and feel based testing
    color shapes static testing.

* what is a locator in selenium?
    - in selenium locator is a means of finding a element in html
        - ID
        - name
        - css
        - Xpath
        - tagName
        - className
        - linkText
        - partialLinkText
* what is xpath?
    - is one of the locators in selenium

* what is difference between Absolute and Relative Xpath?
    - Absolute:
        - Starts with /, starts looking from the root
        element of the html document
    - Relative:
        - Starts with // looks for element in any part of
        the page

* In which situations are you going to use Xpath?
    - when we can not use unique information such as ID, name,
    tags, class ..
    - when dealing with dynamic elements: id changes every time

    we can use contains, starts-with, ends-with
    - when we deal with indexes
    - when we search by text: //span[.= 'submit']
    - when tables xpath can handle parents child sibling

* how do you choose locators?(whats the best locator)
    - it depends on the situation on the web site, on the application
    - If there is ID on web site yes, if no ID then Name,
    - if it is a link:
                    - linktext
                    - partiallinktext
                    - then others
    - if its not a link:
                    - Id
                    - name
                    - tagname
                    - class
                    - css : easy to read and write, fast
                    - Xpath

* css vs Xpath?
    - css:
        - fast easy to read and write, should be used if both
        ccc and xpath are options.
        - does not support index
        - does not support text
    - Xpath:
        - works with text
        - supports index
        - xpath has more convination so its powerful but it can get ugly.

* what is implicit wait / explicit wait?
    - Implicit wait:
                - Syntax: driver.manage.timeouts.implicitlyWait(10)
                - set once always works if it doesnt find element
                it will wait for 10 seconds otherwise it complains
                applies every time when findelement/s method runs
                - The implicit wait will tell to the web driver to
                wait for certain amount of time before it throws a
                "No Such Element Exception".

    - Explicit wait:
                - sometimes we need to wait for certain event
                such as element is visible, clickable, enabled..
                - WebDriverWait,
                - ExpectedConditions
    - FluentWait:
                - is also a type of explicit wait. Using fluent wait
                wecan customize the webDriverWait

* what is difference between Assert and Verify?
    - Assert:
            -  if it fails test execution stops

    - Verify:
            - verify if it fails you make a note and continue with
            the test

* whats difference between QUIT and CLOSE?
    - Quit:
        - closes the windows

    - Close:
        - closes the current tab/window

* how selenium handles drop downs?
    - select class is used to deal with drop down list in selenium.
    to create a select object we need to pass a webElement as
    constructor. that element must have the select tag
    - select by Index: Takes a int param, selects based on the index
    0 based.
    - select by visible text: takes a string, select based on the
    text displayed.
    - select by value: takes a string parameter selects based on
    the value attribute of the option

    - example: WebElement element = driver.findelement(by.id"dropdown")
    Select list = new Select (element)
    list.getFirstSelectedOption;

* how to check the multiple selected value in dropdown?
    - select carsList = new Select(el)
    - carList.getSelectedOption(): returns the selected option
    a list(List<WebElement>)
    - carList.getFirstSelectedOption  <- method that returns
    the selected option(the webElement)
    - asserEquals("Wooden Spoon", carList.getFirstSelectedOption().getText())

* how do you verify all options in dropdown?
    - Select stateList = new Select(el)
    - stateList.getOptions(): returns all the available options
    selected or not

* how to work with dropdown without the select tag?
    - if they dropdown list has no select tag we can not use the
    select class
    - thread the dropdown list and its options as separate
    elements locate every element separately
    - the select an option: 1 find and click

* What is the syntax for switching frame?
    - its html page inside html page / we have to treat them as
    different pages.
    - Iframe/frame : tags for frames. Frame is a html document
    inside another html document.
    - Web driver handles one page at a time to control another frame
    we always need to switch
    - driver.switchTo.frame() : takes webElement -> find the iframe
    and pass it as a param.
    - driver.switchTo.frame() : takes String -> find the id or
    name of the iframe and pass as param
    - driver.switchTo.frame() : takes int -> find the index and pass
    as param

* what is the syntax for switching windows?
    - to handle separate tabs/ windows we have to switch
    to that tab
    - web driver handles one page html document at a time. to
    control another tab we always need to switch

    - to be able to switch we need to get the window handle first
    using getWindowHandesl() method
    - driver.switchTo.window() : takes a string -> window handle
    - for each : driverGetWindowHandles:
        driver.switchTo.window("title")
        if driver.getTitle == expected title
            break;
    - selenium needs the windows handle to switch tabs it doesn not
    use the title. to switch using title we still switch using the
    window handle first then check the title.

* What operations can you do using actions class?
    - Actions class lets us do advanced mouse and keyboard
    operations.
    - Hover over element / move to element
    - scroll up/down
    - double click
    - right click
    - drag and drop
    - keyboard conbinations

* what is the syntax for double click actions?
    - perform any actions against an web element using actions class
    we need to locate the element first
        WebElement el = driver.findElement
        Actions actions = new Actions(driver)
        actions.doubleClick(el);

        actions.moveTO(el)
        actions.doubleClick

* what is the syntax for uploading a file?
    - in order to upload file using selenium  we need to locate
    the upload button in html. the element will have tag
    input then we do sendKeys by passing the path to file
    which
        WebElement upload = driver.findElement
        upload.sendKeys("C:/user/me/file.txt")

* sometimes sendKeys path does not work
    - you have to use the robot or autoid
    - to fix you have to build a dynamic path for file inside
    our project
    - path of the file in the project :
    String projectDir= System.getProperty("usr.dir")
    path of the file in the project :
    "src/test/resources/test_data/myfile.txt"
    - Element.sendKyes(projectDir+file)

* have you done any cross browser testing?
    - yes
    - always mention that you have a control file for keywords
    like browserType main url password username enviroment.

* have you done any headless browser testing?
    - its a browser that does not open it runs as a background service
    or program. They are fast
    - html unitdriver: headless browser that comes from selenium
        webdriver driver = new hemlUnitDRiver();
    - phanthomjsDriver: thrid party driver
        webdriver driver = new htmlUnitDriver();
    - taking screenshots will still work with headless browser

* how you resolve certification issue?
    - IF you are using CHROME, Internet Explorer
        DesiredCapabilities capability = DesiredCapabilities.chrom();
        capability.setcapability(capability.ACCEPT_SSL_CERTS, true );
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","E:/chromedriver.exe")
        driver = new ChromeDriver(capability);
    - more examples badssl.com

* How will do you performance Stress Security SQL injection testing?
    - selenium engineer does not do any of these tests. these tests are done by
    experts trained in these tools.

* how do you handle Js alerts?
    - if the alert on the browser comes from javaScript we use the Alert Interface.
    - Alert alert = driver.switchTo.alert();
    - alert.accept();
    - alert.dismiss();
    - alert.sendkeys();

* 508 Testing?
    - I know what 508 compliance is but on my project am not responsible
      for testing.

* how you handle browser popup?
    - Treat it as another webElement to close find the cancel link
    to the x icon and click();

* how you handle windows/OS pop ups?
    - using the robot or the AutoIT

* Verify element is not displayed?
    - element = driver.findElement()
    - element.isDisplayed();
    - driver.findElement().isDisplayed() -> this line will throw exeption if the element
    is not in the html
         try{
             find
             return if displayed
         }
         Catch(element not fund)
         {return true}

* Why I can not find element?
    - locator changed
    - there is an iframe
    - waiting time : page is loading slowly
    - element is dynamic : locator can not find it
    - page is not fully loaded/opened
    - page changes and that element does not exist anymore

===============================================================================

SELENIUM BOOTCAMP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verify text exists?

* using xpath. write xpath for text

    Xpath for finding any element with certain / exact text:

    //*[.='text']

    Xpath for finding any element that contains certain text:

    //*[contains(text(),'note')]

    getPageSource() -> all the html of the ..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

how do you handle StaleElementExceptions?
    - we can get stale element exception when the element we want to interact with
    is reloaded the webelement we located earlier  does not exisit in the DOM.
    we need to wait until the javascript or the AJAX process to end the locate the
    element again

    example:
            counter = 0;
            while (counter < 5 ){
                try {
                    find and click
                    break;

                    }catch(staleelementexcetion)
                    wait 1 sec
                    counter ++
            }

What is normalization?
    normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy and dependency by organizing
    fields and table of database. the main purpose if to add, delete, or modify field
    that can be made in a single table.

What is denormalization?
    denormalization is technique to access the data from higher to lower normal
    forms of database.

What is a query?
    A database query is a code written in order to get the information back from the database

What is a subquery?
    A subquery is query within another query. the outer query is called as main query.

What are the types of subquery?
    there are two types of subquery, correlated and non-correlated.
    correlated: subquery cannot be consided as indepenedent query.
    non-correlated sub query can be considered as independe query.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you talk about your framework mention this frameworks:

        Page Object model framework
        cucumber Bdd framework
        TestNG based
        Data Driven framework

 ( comes from QTP / UFT style) <- do not mention much because its mostly UFT
        Hybrid Framework
        Keyword Driven Framework

** Tell me about your self SQL **

        I am confortable with front end test automation using java and selenium
        WebDriver, Cucumber, Maven, Testng, Junit also i am good at restful API
        test automation using postman and restassured library in JAVA. I have rich
        experience with database test automation using sql queries along with JDBC library
        in JAVA.

* data driven Testing ?
    - data driven framework when do we do it?

    - When: Whenever a functionality  or a module in an app requires testing with
            multiple sets of data(also called parametrization)
            multiple imputs then we need to perform data driven testing and automation.
            these scenarios are one of the things that must be automated.

    - How: Test data is separated from code and stored into external sources. Excel files,
            CSV files, Database.

    BENEFIT: more organized data centralized collaboration on test data it can come with
            BA, MTs, ETC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how to read data from excel?
    - I use Apache POI to read data from excel or any excel related tests

        EXAMPLE:
        String file = "TestData.xlsx";
        FileImputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(file);

        String filePath = "C:\\user\\alex\\Desktop";
        FileInputStream instream = new FileInputStream(filePath);
        Workbook workBook = WorkbookFactory.create(inStream);
        Sheet worksheet = workBook.getsheet(0);
        Row row = workSheet.getRow(0);
        Cell cel = row.getCell(0);
        System.out.println(cell.toString());

        WRITE DATA:
                CENTRAL MAVEN REPO -> WE ARE USING
                COMPANY MAVEN REPO -> YOU USE AT WORK


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* read Data From Database?
        - Manually: Oracle  SQL developer <- for manually testing
        - Automation: JDBC -> JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY <- is used for automation


        Hierarchy of Objects:
                                CONNECTION -> STATEMENT -> RESULTSET
        HOW TO STABLISH CONNECTION:
                                Connetion conn = DriverManger.getConnection("URL","username","password")
                                Statement stat = connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_...)
                                ResultSet resu = statement.executeQuery("select * from countries");

        - test data is separted from code ..

        - if the amount of data is not that huge then i use cucumber scenario outline with example
        table

        - and other times i maintain test data in excel files and i use apache POI library
        to read and write data using JAVA

        - if data comes from a database or i need to do datase validiation
        i use sql queries along with JDBC library in java

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* where do we close connection in database in try catch block
in case we will get exeption thrown. " in catch block"

    1) in finally block
    2) i use try-with-resources and it will automatically close

        Example 1: in fanally block

                try{
                        Connetion conn = DriverManger.getConnection("URL","username","password")
                        Statement stat = connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_...)
                        ResultSet resu = statement.executeQuery("select * from countries");
                }catch(SQLException e){
                        //some code to report
                        e.printStackTrace();
                }finally{
                        try{
                        result.close();
                        statement.close();
                        connection.close();
                        }catch(exception e){
                                // some code
                        }
                }

        Example 2: try-with-resources

        any class or interface that extends closable or autoclosable interface


                try(
                        Connetion conn = DriverManger.getConnection("URL","username","password")
                        Statement stat = connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_...)
                        ResultSet resu = statement.executeQuery("select * from countries");)
                {
                        //some code to read data from resulset
                }
                }catch(SQLException e){
                        //some code to report
                        e.printStackTrace();
                }

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* have you done any BACK END TESTING or DATABASE TESTING?(they mean API and Database)

        - Yes I have lots of experience with working with databases and
          I am confortable with writing SQL queries. I have experience with working on relational
          databases like ORACLE, MySQL, SQL Server.

        - Have you worked with non-relational databases?
                - I dont have hands on experience i know that its is like JSON
                  format database and i have good experience with working with JSON
                  files. And I am quick learner and crosfunctional.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how do you create a table in SQL what are constraints?

        - create table computer(
                computer_id number primary key,
                brand varchar2(20) not null,
                type char(1) not null
                );

        - SQL column constraints:
                Primary key, foreign key, null,not null unique.

        - Describe computers -> to display table information metadata of table
                Describe computers;

        - insert data in SQL database
                insert into computers values( 123 ,'HP','L');
                select * from computers

* SQL technical interview
        1.	Write a SQL query to find how many records are there in Town table where
        “TOWN_NAME” has “ell” in them?
                - select count(*)
                from town
                where town_name like '%ell%';

        2.	Write a SQL query to find how many occurrences of each “COUNTRY_CODE” are
        there in the Town table?
                - select country_code,count(*)
                from town
                Group by country_code;

        3.	Write a SQL query to find the “TOWN_NAME” where there are non-alphanumeric
        characters? REGEX is used for matching some formats like 10 number etc
                select(*)
                from town
                where town_name not like '%[^a-zA-Z0-9]%';


        4.	Write a SQL query to select the first 5 records from Town table?
                select *
                from town
                where rownum <= 5;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Inner JOIN interview
                - when we query data from multiple tables we need joins and when we need
                to find matching records we use inner joins.
                - inner join is used when we need to display data from multiple tables.
                and it will return matching records.

        1.Write a SQL query to find the salary for the people working in the QA department
        and the HR Department?

                select empid, name, salary, deptid
                from employee e join departments d
                on e.empid = d.empid
                where deptid in('QA','HR');


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* selfJoin interview ( )
        1.
        select emp.employee_id, emp.first_name, man.first_name, man.last_name
        from employees emp join employees man
        on emp.manager_id = man.employee_id;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* inner join vs outer join
        - we need joins when ever we need query data from multiple tables

        1.Inner join returns matching records from both tables according to joining condition
        2.outter join returns matching data plus non matching data either from right
          or left tables.

          Example: inner join
                select last_name, department_name
                from employees join departments
                on employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between Union and Union ALL
        - we use these set operators when we need to display data from multiple or 2 queries
        - UNION: removes duplicates and null values and sorts the result,
        - UNION ALL: does not remove duplicates and does not sort
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between Intersect and Minus
        - INTERSECT: displays common data en both queries
        - MINUS: returns records from first query that is not present in second query.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* JOIN VS UNION interview question
        - joins are used to display query from multiple tables
        - Union is used to query data from multiple queries.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between GROUP BY vs ORDER BY
        - group by is used whenever we work with group functions it will help to
        create sub groups within a group
        - order by is used to sort either descending and ascending
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between HAVING vs WHERE
        Ans: HAVING is used to specify a condition for a group or an aggregate function
        used in select statement. The WHERE clause selects before grouping. The HAVING
        clause selects rows after grouping. Unlike HAVING clause, the WHERE clause cannot
        contain aggregate functions.

        - when ever our condition includes a group founction
        example: HAVING max(salary) > 9000;

        - where is used to filter the results and when we do not use group function
        example: where employee_id = 234;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Display 5th row from table ( CORE RELATED SUB QUERY)

        - we need to use correlated subquery
        - inner query will get columns along with rownumber and outer query will look
        for specific row number

        example 1:
        select *
        from (select employee_id,first_name, rownum as rn from employees)
        where rn = 5;

        example 2:
        (select * from employees where rownum <=5)
        minus
        (select * from employees where rownum <=4);

        example 3: 5th largest salary questions
        select salary from employees e1
        where 5= (select count(salary)
        from employees e2 where e1.salary<=e2.salary);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between drop vs truncate

        - both are ddl commands and cannot be undone,
        - drop will remove data and table together
        - truncate will remove all data but not table structure.
        - DROP EMPLOYEES;
        - TRUNCATE EMPLOYEES;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Commit commands
        - when ever we make changes to database we can commit to save changes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* do you know SQL?
        - yes I have experience and i am confortable with writing SQL queries DDL and DML
        commands. currently working with oracle database that is running in amazon cloud server.

        - WHAT IS DDL? data definition language : create alter drop truncate
        - DML data manipulation languages: select delete insert update
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* What is SQL?
        - SQL is Structured Query Language designed for inserting and modifying in a relational database system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*What is the difference between primary key and unique constraints?
        - Ans: Primary key cannot have NULL value, the unique constraints can have NULL values.
         There is only one primary key in a table, but there can be multiple unique constrains.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL? STRUCTURE QUERY LANGUAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* what kind of database testing are you doing?
        - I am mostly doing database validations
        - I make changes or insert data in the front end and validate in the database
          Data in front end matches the database
        - i also make changes using RESTapi and verify that changes are successfull in database
          as well
        - I also support database migration process, My code connects to all database
          Sybase (legacy database) using JDBC then connects to oracle (new DB )
          and then compare records to make sure data was migrated successfully


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Batch jobs of application?
    - some automated code that runs every night time and make some status changes
      to some data

    Example: coupon that is valid for  7 days. Batch job is scanning through each coupon and if
    coupon hit 7 days it will update the status in database as invalid.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* do you have experience with RestfulAPI Testing?
    - application in the current project needs to be integrated to other internal
    and external application for the integration our team developed restful api so i am testing it.

    - i verify rest api end point is working as expected
    i use postman for manual api testing and use restassured library in java for automation
    i send post put get delete type of request and veirfy responses stasus code and response body header
    i also do positive and negative testing of api.
    when i do positive testing i send valid request parameters, valid headers valid request json body
    and verify that response stuatus code i 200
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* http methods/request?
    - get: read data
    - post: create
    - put: update
    - delete: delete

    - post vs put

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Status code
    2×× Success
    200 OK
    201 Created

    3×× Redirection
    300 Multiple Choices
    301 Moved Permanently
    302 Found

    4×× Client Error
    400 Bad Request
    401 Unauthorized
    402 Payment Required
    403 Forbidden
    404 Not Found

    5×× Server Error
    500 Internal Server Error
    501 Not Implemented
    502 Bad Gateway
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Headers
    - accept, content-type, application JSON, Application XML
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* parameters
    - 2 types
    - path parameters ( value will be part of URL)
    - query / request parameters(key+value format)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Validate/check /assert JSON body
    - {
        "employee_id": 100,
        "first_name": "steven"
    }

    we use hamcrest matcher that comes with restassured library
    - 1.When().get(uri).then().body("first_name",equalto("steven"));

    using jsonpath:
    - 2.JsonPath json = when().get(uri).thenreturn().body().jsonpath();
    assert.asserEquals(json.getString("last_name"),"king");


    - 3.Using collections. HashMap
    Response response = when().get(uri);
    Map map = response.body().as(Map.class);
    assert.assertEquals(map.get(job_id),"AD_PRES");

    - 4.Using POJOs. create a class first
    public class employee{}
    Response response = when().get(uri);
    Employee map = response.body().as(Employee.class);
    assert.assertEquals(emp.getSalary(),24000);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Serealization vs DE-Serealization
    - serealization: convert java object to Json
    - De-serialization: JSON to java Object
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Gson Parser
    - Gson parser is used to convert json to java object or vise versa
    - 2 useful methods from json tojjson

* what tools used to develop your application?
    - Java Spring -> back end code of the website
    - angular -> front end of the application
    - Tomcat server -> developers use it hosts the website
    - Oracle Database -> Database
    - jenkins -> to deploy the application
    - Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea
    - SonarCube -> code coverage age tool
    - Docker -> host, deploy


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* describe your framework 1 TestNG + selenium
    - JAVA
    - MAVEN
    - TestNG
    - SELENIUM
    - EXTEND REPORTS : works with testng and selenium for reports
    - LOG4J
    - JDBC
    - REST ASSURED
    - APACHE POI


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* describe your framework 2 ( CUCUMBER BDD FRAMEWORK)
    - TESTNG / JUNIT ( ONE OF THEM NOT BOTH)
    - CUCUMBER
    - JAVA
    - MAVEN
    - SELENIUM
    - HTML REPORTING
    - JDBC
    - REST ASSURED
    - APACHE POI
    - GIT
    - JENKINS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* HOW DOES YOUR FRAMEWORK GENERATE?
    - our cucumber BDD framework generates HTML reports
    - the reports shows the pass/fail coverage for feature files
    tags,steps.
    - the report contains the steps for each test
    - the report has screenshots for failures

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how do you take screenshot in your framework?
    - IN my framework i have the logic for taking screen screenshots
    in the hook class. that is because i want to take screenshot
    even if the test fails. Hook guarantees that the method for screenshot
    will work even if test fails.

        - TakeScreenshot interface is the method used to take the screenshot. It
        comes from selenium interface.
        - this report is the same report used in my jenkins test. when
        on jenkins i generate the report using the cucumber reports plugin
        - when i run locally same report is generated by the configuration in the pom
        file.
        - both of this configuration options use the Json file to generate report
            PLUGIN = "json...."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* what do you use for logging?
    - i use log4j for logging. i always log important steps in the test executing
    that helps me to debut when there is a failure.
    - log4j is not a replacement for html reports.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* What is POM?
(POM) Page Object Model is an Object Repository design pattern in Selenium WebDriver.
 POM creates our testing code maintainable, reusable. Page Factory is an optimized
 way to create object repository in POM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how does the feature file work? tell me the syntax of an entire feature file
    - feature -> description of what is being tested
    - scenario -> description of the scenario being tested
        - Given ->  a precondition
        - When ->  condition that triggers the expected result
        - Then ->

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* cucumber scenario example
    - Given i am on the login page
    - And i enter username and password
    - When i click on the submit button
    - Then i should be able to see the profile picture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Sample of feature file
    - Feature: log in fuctionality
    - Background:" anything common will go in background "
                 Given I am on the log in page
    - Scenario: 1
    - Scenario: 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Scenario Outline
    - Scenario outline: search
    - Given I am there
    - And I search for "<item>"
    Example:
    |item|
    |wooden spoon|
    |carbon fiber spoon|

    * the scenario will run twise first time it will search for wooden spoon
    next time will search for carbon fiber spoong


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* what is test base class? and how do you implement in your framework?
    - When we talk about test base class we talk about framework 1 only
    - test base class is class where i have most used methods in my test
      my test classes extend the test base class and thus have access to those
      methods this helps us make my code reusable

    - Before/after test methods
    - wait/synchronization utility methods
    - switchToWindow(title)
    - WebDriver driver;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* How to re-run the failed tests again?
    - it is different depending on what tools are being used?
          THIS ID DONE IN POM *
        - In TESTNG : framework (not cucumber), failed tests are reported in the
                    testng_failed.xml file in target folder. we can add
                    this file in the pom file so that maven will try to run the
                    failed tests every time. it will only run when there are failures
                    in the test.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how to rerun the failed tests again in cucumber?
    - to re-run the failed tests in cucumber we use the re-run option
      in the CukesRunner
        1: Add the re-run to cukes runner. this option will create a file with a
           list of failed tests.
        2: create a second runner class which points to file with a list of
           failed tests
        3: Add the second runner in pom file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how to run failed tests again in Jenkins?
    - in jenkins there are plugin that are run the failed tests. Unit cases(not cucumber)
    -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how to run tests selectively cucumber?
    - tags keyword the CukesRunner
    - feature keyword the CukesRunner
    - tags and features can also be passed using the command line
        - mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options="--tags ~@nonexistantTag"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* please choose one user story from your current application and walk me through
for the automation?
    - //come up with 1 or 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* What is your thropy bug?
    - //come up with 1 or 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* How you intergrate selenium with JIRA?
    - selenium does not have a built in integration with JIRA. but there are plugins that
    integrate selenium testing framework with jira.
    - XRAY(jira plugin, Jenkins plugin)
    - Zephyr(jira plugin)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* when do you do automation in your sprint?
    - When developers are done with their part
    - When code is deployed to QA/test environment
    - when all manual test are done
    - if you are test in the staging/UAT environment you wont be testing
      stories which are being develop.
    - You are in  team of testers. all the stories you get in your team are
      testing stories and ready to be tested.
    - you are part of a mixed team with testers and developers in this case
      you will test features which are being developed so you want for developer
      to finish the code changes and push to QA environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Have you set up any job in jenkings?
    -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* * where do you store the test results/reports?
    - the location of the reports depends n how we are running
    them.
    - if we are running locally, reports will be generated in the
    target folder. my framework generates cucumber reports folder in the targer
    foder which contains the report
    - when we run the tests on jenkins jenkins saves the report
    of every run. all the reports for previous runs can be found under
    the build number.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* How do you GET TEST DATA?
    - delphix -> tool/or company that provides test data
    - in my project there were 2 sources for test data
        1. Developers got the data from production database changed the sensitive
        information
        2. i had to generate test data. in my job i had to generate
        test data for parking tickets i had to use selenium to fill the form to create
        parking tickets in the test environment.
    - java faker
    - apache also has couple dips

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* what coding standards to you have?
    - in my project we had a formatter for code format. everyone had to use the same
    formating standard.
    - in my company one of the things we check during the code review
    is the coding standards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how many environment do you have?
    - in my project we had the following enviroments:
        1. dev enviroments
        2. QA/Test enviroment- this is where i test
        3. Staging enviroment
        4.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* How do you code review?
    - in my company we use cricuable to do code reviews. it only works
        with bitbucket
    - In github it is different:
        - you check in code
        - create a pull request
        - Some will review the pull request and merge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Who will review your code?
    - other testers
    - test lead.

WebTables in Selenium HTML

    WebTables are data arranged in a grid format
    Table tag used for table.

        th --> tag used for columm name

        tr   --> tag used to indicate a row it applies to all columns it is the whole row Horizontal

        td  --> tag used to indicate a columm in a row vertical

        table

            tr
                    th th th.  --> colum name
            tr
                    td td td.  --> actual data

        tbody --> used to indicate the data of the table does not include colum names

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF the Slashes are in the begining
    // --> Relative Xpath search anywhere in the page
                //table[@class='ProductsTable']

    /  --> Absolute Xpath search starting from the root element(html tag)
                /html/head/body/liv/....

    // --> if the slashes are in the middle of a Xpath mean any child or decendant, is a direct child
                //table[@class='ProductsTable']//th
                //table[@class='ProductsTable']//th[2]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a method that accepts a locator by object
returns arraylist containing texts for all matching findElements


store into browserUtil class


	public static List<String> getElementsText(By locator){

		List<WebElement> elems = driver.findElements(locator);
		List<String> elemTexts = new ArrayList<>();

		for(WebElement el : elems){
			if(!el.gettext().isEmpty()){
			elemTexts.add(el.getText());
			}
		}
		return elemTexts;
	}


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPIC > User Stories > Test Cases


What kind of Test cases?
	When you write test cases you cover different scenarios
	Scenarios.

	Positive
	Negative
	Boundary value analysis




User Stories = can have multiple user Stories

Test Cases = can have multiple test Cases




RTM: requirement tracebility matrix

Mapping Test cases with user story


-------------------------------------------------------------

SoftAssert = is a class provided by testNG, provides assertion methods
Which will not stop the execution if any of them fail

when softAssert class is used assertion method do not run immediatly

@Test
        public void test() {
                SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();

                softAssert.assertEquals(1, 1);
                softAssert.assertAll();

        }

Without softAssert.AssertAll() it will not show what has failed so its
important

AssertAll() --> this method will actually run the assertions and report
this method has to be caleld when soft assertions are user

Assert.fail() when this line is called the test will fail. This method



------------------------------------------------------------------------

WebDriverWait --> its a class that lets us wait for certain actions

		- wait until element with id "id" becomes visible on page (if page takes long to load)
		- wait until element with id "id" disappears
		- wait until element with id "id" has certain Text
		- wait until element with id "id" becomes clickable

WebDriverWait needs 2 things:
	- 1. element or locator
	- 2. condition

WebDriverWait has 2 constructor arguments:
	-1. webdriver Object,
	-2. time duration -> it only takes SECONDS

Example:

	wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector("#finish h4")));

HTTP STATUS codes

1xx — Informational — These are provisional responses intended to be used while the
    server continues to process the request. They are seldom used.

2xx — Success — Codes used when things work as they are supposed to.
    Different success codes are returned based on what, specifically, the
    request was attempting to do.

3xx — Redirection — Codes used to tell the client to look for the requested
    resource somewhere else.

4xx — Client Error — These codes tell the client that it did something wrong.

5xx — Server Error — Code for when something on the server isn't working as expected.
